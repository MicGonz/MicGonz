## üíªüì°  Telecommunications Engineering
---
I am passionate about telecommunications and the transformative impact of this field‚Äôs constant technological evolution.


I am currently writing my PhD dissertation on statistical performance bounds in integrated communication and sensing networks, which seek to unify communication and sensing services within a single, resource-sharing infrastructure. Looking forward to to contribute with the advance of this amazing research topic!

## üíªüß† Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
---

My journey in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science blends research, applied development, and production-ready solutions.

I specialize in:

- ‚úÖ **Risk Modeling and Validation**, including Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Market Risk, Microcredit, and Climate & Environmental Risk.
- ‚úÖ Development of **challenger models** using techniques like **MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM, XGBSE**, and clustering algorithms such as **KMeans, PAM, CLARA**.
- ‚úÖ Implementation of probabilistic models like **Value at Risk (VaR)**, **Probability of Default**, **Credit Risk**.
- ‚úÖ **Anomaly detection systems**, particularly for event logs using machine learning algorithms like **Isolation Forest**.
- ‚úÖ Advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** applied to trajectory prediction with **Transformer models (Huggingface)**, treating sequences of geospatial points as sentences.
- ‚úÖ Model Governance, Reproducibility, EDA, Benchmarking, Feature Engineering, and Model Performance Evaluation.
